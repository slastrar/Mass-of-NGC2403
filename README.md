<h1>Galaxy Mass Estimation Using Rotation Curves</h1>

This project focuses on calculating the mass of a galaxy based solely on its rotation curve. Using Python, I implemented multiple astrophysical models to perform the calculations, integrating theoretical knowledge with practical coding.

The goal was to explore how rotation curves can provide insights into galactic mass distribution, applying physics and programming to solve a key problem in astrophysics.

Feel free to explore the code and reach out with any questions or suggestions!
